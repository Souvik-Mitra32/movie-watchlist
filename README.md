# Movie-Watchlist

## About
This is my first project which includes frontend and backend both. I built a website where you can search movies online, create/view/delete watchlists, add/remove movies to the watchlist.

## Goal
This is a capstone project for testing the CRUD operations using APIs and also little bit of plain html and css (no frontend framework used).

## Skills
The project required the following skills
* HTML, CSS, JS
* Node JS and Express
* PostgresQL
* REST API
* EJS
* GitHub

## Installation Guide

1. Clone this project
2. Pull it into your local system
3. Install neccessary node modules (i.e. npm i)
4. Create a table in your database named "watchlist" with the columns - id, name, movie_ids, description
5. Go to the file, root directory > src > config > db.js (type - 'src/config/db.js') and setup your own database.
6. Once done, you can run the server with the command 'npm start'
7. The home path should be 'http://localhost:3000'

## Known issues
The website is created only focusing in mind of its functionality and connection between the frontend and backend. So it may not be perfect from html element's class names or css style organization. The front end code is not readable enough and might cause issues while scaling.

## Opportunities
* Adding user registration and login
* Adding responsiveness for all screen sizes
* Adding features like sharing watchlists with other users
